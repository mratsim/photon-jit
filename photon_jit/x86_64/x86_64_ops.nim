# ################################################################

# Notes:
#   - The imm64 version will generate a proc for uint64 and int64
#     and another one for pointers immediate
#   - The dst64, imm32 version will generate a proc for uint32 and int32
#     and a proc for int literals (known at compile-time)
#     that will call proc(reg, imm32) if the int is small enough.
#     ---> (dst64, imm64) should be defined before (dst64, imm32)
